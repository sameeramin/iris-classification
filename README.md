# iris-classification
A machine learning model to classify Irsis flower

## What problem am I trying to solve?
I am trying to use attributes of flowers to predict the species of flower. Specifically, I'm trying to use the sepal length, width and petal length and width to predict if an Iris Flower is of _Setosa, _Versicolor or _Virginica.

This is a multiclass classification problem.
